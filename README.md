SQL Final Project ‚Äì Data Analyst Training (Alfa Training)
Includes database creation, functions, indexes, and stored procedures.



Overview
This project was created as part of my Data Analyst training at Alfa Training.  
It demonstrates SQL skills including database design, data manipulation, stored procedures, views, indexes, and functions.

The goal was to simulate a small business database and perform analysis efficiently using SQL.


 Project Structure

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `Create, insert.sql` | Creates tables and inserts sample data |
| `Funktionen.sql` | Defines SQL functions (e.g. VAT calculation) |
| `index and views.sql` | Creates indexes and views for performance and reporting |
| `Bis stored procedure.sql` | Stored procedures for data analysis and reporting |
| `er diagram.docx` | Database Entity Relationship Diagram |

echnologies Used
- SQL Server / MySQL**
- Relational database design**
- Indexes, Views, Stored Procedures**
- Data cleaning and analysis**

---

Key Learnings
- Designing normalized database tables  
- Creating and using functions and procedures  
- Performance tuning with indexes  
- Building reusable SQL logic for analytics

How to Run üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è:
1. Open your SQL environment (SQL Server Management Studio or MySQL Workbench).  
2. Run scripts in this order:
   1. `Create, insert.sql`
   2. `Funktionen.sql`
   3. `index and views.sql`
   4. `Bis stored procedure.sql`
3. Explore results with `SELECT` queries or stored procedures.



Next Steps ( In thi case, need to add bit more data)
- Add Power BI dashboard connected to this database  
- Automate reports using Python (pandas + SQLAlchemy)  
- Extend data with sales analytics
